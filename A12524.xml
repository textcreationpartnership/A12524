            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>and this treaſure hath hee put in earthen veſſels, that the excellency of the power might be of God, and not of man.</hi> Thus was <hi>Dauid</hi> choſen from the ſheep-fold, and many of the Prophets from their Heards. <hi>Matthew</hi> from amongſt the Publicans, and <hi>Saul</hi> from the ſtate of a Phariſie and a Supplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to bee a maſter builder in his Church.</p>
               <p>And this reaſon why the Lord hath committed the diſpenſation of his word, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to men rather then to Angels, is, becauſe none can be ſo neerely touched with the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of man, as man, themſelues hauing experience of the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their brethren; the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the heart, the buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Sathan, and deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne; and this the Author

               <p>Seeing then that God hath choſe ſuch inſtruments for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> we are taught then not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe thoſe whom God hath thus honoured.

               <p>For the preuenting of this in the Prophet <hi>Ezechial,</hi> the Lord tels him aforehand, <hi>The houſe of Iſrael will not hearken vnto thee,</hi>

                  <hi>for they will not hearken vnto me:</hi> yet the Lord would haue him to doe this duty, and to leaue the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to him.

               <p>He that laboureth to bring men to heauen, though hee effect not his deſire, ſhall notwithſtanding haue his reward.

               <p>Secondly, ſuch doe not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the word to ſome, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is to be the ſauour of death vnto death, as it is vnto others, to be the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of life to life: which thing were it duely conſidered, Mini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſters would looke more to their owne duties, and meddle leſſe with the ſucceſſe of their miniſtery,

               <p>By this then men may try them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, whether they be called or not, and whether God hath truely touched their hearts with the knowledge of his ſonne Chriſt.

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:19722:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>publike duties. I may ſay of ſuch a mans ſoule, as of the houſe ſhut vp with the Plague, <hi>Lord haue mercy on them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gods people if at any time they grow dull or heauy in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of holy duties, here they are refreſhed, quickned, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; theſe meetings reuiue a mans ſpirits, and put a kind of heauenly life in him. Blow the coles, and if there be any fire, it will ſhew it ſelfe; ſo will grace in the heart, when the gales of the Word ſhall blow vpon it. Now then to finde no taſte, no reliſh, no comfort at all in theſe ordinances of God, is a cleare demonſtration of a dead heart, and a graceleſſe ſoule.</p>
               <p>But what though for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thou canſt not finde that comfort in the word, yet in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to theſe publike aſſemblies, thou ſhalt teſtifie thy homage to

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:19722:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>Chriſt, to haue their period and determination.</p>

                  <p>But what was the reaſon why Chriſt was thus perplexed in the garden,<note place="margin">Q.</note> before he was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or taken?</p>
                  <p>This was not for feare of the bodily death that Chriſt was now to ſuffer,<note place="margin">R.</note> as it appeareth by the godly reſolution and courage of many of the bleſſed martyrs of Chriſt, who albeit they were men that, no doubt, had their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet did readily and willingly embrace the ſentence of death without any ſuch agony.</p>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:19722:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>But this aroſe principally from the ſenſe of the moſt horrible wrath and diſpleaſure of God his father, that at this time lay ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy vpon him for the ſinnes of the world, and which he was now to endure and to vndergoe.

                  <p>The martyrs were perſwaded that their ſinnes were pardoned, and the guilt thereof done away through Chriſt, by which means
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:19722:166" rendition="simple:additions"/>they feared not death, the ſting thereof being plucked out, for <hi>the ſting of death is ſinne.</hi> Whereas Chriſt in his death,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> as our ſurety, ſtands charged with the ſinnes of all the world, and now was to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie Gods wrath for the ſame; and hence it was that hee was left to himſelfe voyd of comfort in the middeſt of all his ſufferings, and prayes againſt the terrours of death, whereas thoſe bleſſed mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs were aſſured and ſupported with the inward conſolations of Gods ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>But was this all that Chriſt did ſuffer and vndergoe for vs? oh no. I remember the Lords ſpeech vnto <hi>Eliah,</hi> being diſtreſſed at mount Horeb, and lying hidden in a caue alone, the Lord ſaith thus vnto him, <hi>What doſt thou here Eliah? ariſe, for thou haſt yet a further iourney to goe.</hi> So

If then thou wouldſt haue true comfort by this Sacrament, this is required of thee, that thou beleeue.</p>
               <p>The point is cleared by that of our Sauiour vnto his Diſciples, immediately before his aſcention vp into heauen.<note place="margin">Mat. 16.15, 16.</note>

               <p>And therefore the practiſe of the Primitiue Church herein was moſt commendable, who had their <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> a certaine ſort of people that were well inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the principles of Religion, and then were admitted to the Sacraments of <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> being drawne to the Church from Heatheniſme and Paganiſme.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the common anſwer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is good: That the children of beleeuing parents haue a right to the Sacrament, in regard of the couenant that God made with them and their ſeed. And the faith of euery true beleeuer is ſo farre the Infants, that it giues it an intereſt into the Sacrament; for the beleeuing parent laies hold on the couenant, not onely for himſelfe, but alſo for his ſeed. As in the title of Lands at this day, a man doth purchaſe lands to him and his heires after him. And this is warranted by that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>That hee that will not worke, ſhould not eate.</hi> That therefore Infants ought not to be nouriſhed, becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not labour.</p>
               <p>But, ſay they, it is not found in all the Scriptures that any one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant was baptiſed by the Apoſtles. Neither is there mention made that they were excluded. If this

               <p>For the further clearing of this truth, we are to know, that Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſerues to the ſame end to vs, that Circumciſion did to the Iewes in the time of the lawe.
